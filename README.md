# SwerveCode 2025

hi! this is jack. This is code from CTRE Swerve gernator that was modfied to fucntion for next year. All of it was first tested on 10/2/2024. 

I want to keep track off the progress of swerve with a log. I know i can just check commits but that is boring.

First update 10/1/2024
-Implemeted PathPlanner for Autonomous mode. I threw together like 3 autos for us to test that just stick to moving around the field. 
Second update 10/2/2024 
-Fixed pathplanner as I had swapped numbers around. Driving is having issues with the stick drift on the XBOX controller looking to update that.
